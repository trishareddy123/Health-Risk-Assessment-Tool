The Health Risk Assessment Tool is a Python-based application designed to evaluate potential health risks based on user-provided health information. The project collects basic inputs such as age, weight, lifestyle habits, and other relevant parameters, then processes this data using logical conditions to determine possible risk levels.

The tool aims to support early awareness of health conditions by providing quick and simple assessments. It features a user-friendly command-line interface, making it easy for beginners to use and understand. This project is suitable for academic purposes and serves as a foundation that can be extended with advanced analytics, additional health parameters, or machine learning models in the future.
